### Convex Hull
QuickHull algorithm for finding the smallest polygon enclosing a set of points.
Author: Olivier Jacot-Descombes.

Based on the Java Script implementation https://github.com/claytongulick/quickhull by Clay Gulick.

Compared to two Graham Scan implementations I experimented with, this QuickHull implementation is much more stable. Graham Scan suffers from numerical problems due to floating point imprecision (probably due to the delicate relative angle calculations).

The Quick hull algorithm has an expected runtime of **O(n log(n))**.

Although the point coordinates are given as `float`, we do all calculations in `double` precision.

### Bounding Rectangles
Methods that find oriented bounding rectangles from an unsorted set of points or from a convex hull. Uses the **rotating calipers** algorithm.

You can find the best bounding rectangle through a delegate specifying the desired criteria like smallest aera, smallest width, smallest side ratio, etc.
